# landing-page

This is my second project within the Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum. I will be demonstrating my knowledge of using HTML elements to build the framework of the webpage. Then I will use CSS styling and Flexbox layout properties to make the webpage look professionally presentable.

Note: the webpage may not look appealing on a mobile device, and that is okay. I created this webpage to work with desktops and laptops in mind. It is possible that I may revisit this project to make it mobile-friendly.
